<h4 id="scrna-seq">scRNA-seq</h4>
<p>This page utilises the visualisation tool, <a href="http://vitessce.io/">Vitessce</a>, to display our single-cell transcriptomics data. It allows you to query gene expression and explore information about each cell in various reduced dimensional spaces.</p>

<h4 id="histology-rnascope">Histology/RNAscope</h4>
<p>On this page, you can interatcively explore a representative set of images from our histology and RNAscope datasets.</p>

<h4 id="genome-annotation">Genome annotation</h4>
<p>On this page we use the <a href="https://igv.org/">Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)</a> to display our edited rabbit transcriptome and the read coverage for an individual GD8 sample from our 10X single-cell RNA-seq data. This can used to assess the annotation quality for particular genes of interest, such as in cases where no expression is observed in the processed dataset.</p>

<p>See the &#39;<em>Improving transcriptome mapping</em>&#39; section of the paper methods for more information on how the modified rabbit transcriptome annotation was produced.</p>

<h4 id="compare-neighbourhoods-3d">Compare neighbourhoods 3D</h4>
<p>This visualisation highlights rabbit and mouse neighbourhoods which have a high similarity across the two species. As you hover/click on each rabbit (or mouse) neighbourhood, the top 5 most highly correlated neighbourhoods in the other species are highlighted.</p>
<p>See the '<em>Neighbourhood comparisons</em>' section of the paper for more details.</p>
