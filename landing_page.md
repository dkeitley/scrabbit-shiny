### Pages

#### scRNA-seq

This page utilises the visualisation tool, [Vitessce](http://vitessce.io/), to display our single-cell transcriptomics data. It allows you to query gene expression and explore information about each cell in various reduced dimensional spaces.

#### Histology/RNAscope

On this page, you can interatcively explore a representative set of images from our histology and RNAscope datasets.

#### Genome annotation

On this page we use the [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](https://igv.org/) to display our edited rabbit transcriptome and the read coverage for an individual GD8 sample from our 10X single-cell RNA-seq data. This can used to assess the annotation quality for particular genes of interest, such as in cases where no expression is observed in the processed dataset.

See the '*Improving transcriptome mapping*' section of the paper methods for more information on how the modified rabbit transcriptome annotation was produced.

#### Compare neighbourhoods 3D

This visualisation shows how rabbit and mouse neighbourhoods relate across species. As you hover/click on each rabbit (or mouse) neighbourhood, the top 5 most highly correlated neighbourhoods in the other species are highlighted.

See the *Neighbourhood comparisons* section of the paper for more details.
